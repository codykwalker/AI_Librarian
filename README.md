I am a librarian of the District of Columbia Public Library system. After observing the way people interact with the library’s collection, I became interested in how they select books through the incidental act of browsing. Despite each person having their own perspective, they exhibit common methods of browsing through a physical examination of the book’s cover. While the popular idiom is “Don’t judge a book by its cover”, readers, writers, publishers, and designers all seem to disagree. Every reader knows the excitement of seeing a book cover that unexpectedly attracts their attention. They may not be able to fully articulate why–it may be the cover’s resemblance to something they already like, a design that appeals to their aesthetic sensibilities–but the effect is undeniable.


Information systems such as the library catalog (and the commonly used, unwieldy Dewey Decimal System) are often unsuited to people’s natural browsing habits.  Using my experience as a librarian and bookseller, I decided to explore the connection between browsing habits and the physical similarities of book covers, a project with the aim of allowing people to more easily manage their browsing by collating book covers based on physical similarity.
